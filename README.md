These are just some scripts I've been using, and I needed a place to store them

- `BasicChaseEnemy1.cs` - script for enemies to chase a target, typically the player
- `BasicEntityRepulsion1.cs` - function for entities to repel each other to prevent stacking, such as with chase scripts
- `BasicPlayerMovement` - script that allows 2D, top-down movement with camera rotation
- `CombineVector2s` - function to combine two Vector2s with weights
